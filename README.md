# Limnoseries_Debugging
Limnoseries - Debugging in R

May 2023, Jorrit Mesman

## Description
This workshop gives an introduction to debugging and problem-solving in R, although most methods can be applied in some shape
or form in other programming languages as well.

## Outline
- Introductory presentation
- Live coding session
- Questions & Exercises

## Instructions before the workshop
Have a working R setup and clone this repository. We'll use the "DebuggingInR_script_with_errors.R" for the live coding, and should end up with the
the "DebuggingInR_script_fixed.R" script at the end. The files in the "data" folder will be used in the script. 

The only packages that you will need to install beforehand are 'data.table' and 'ggplot2'
